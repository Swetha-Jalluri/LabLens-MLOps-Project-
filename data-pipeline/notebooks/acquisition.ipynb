She also\\nhad elevated INR and was given medication to lower INR\\nalthough there was no evidence of bleeding.\\n\\nLast night, she reports having increased difficulty with\\nbreathing.  She has also had a cough.  She denies any fever\\nor chills.  The patient admitted to decreased p.o. intake but\\nhas been recently sedimentary.  She denies any swelling of\\nthe legs.

Pulmonary - Dyspnea secondary to chronic obstructive\\npulmonary disease/emphysema under this hospital course.\\nBriefly, the patient received BIPAP, ....................,\\nintravenous Solu-Medrol, nebulizer treatment and inhaler\\ntreatment while in the Intensive Care Unit.  She was able to\\nbe weaned off of the oxygen back to room air, sating to about\\n93 or 94 percent.\\n\\nThough her chest x-rays show hyperinflation and no signs of\\ninfection, she was given five days worth of Zithromax.  An\\nechocardiogram was to rule out any cardiac wheezes which then\\nshowed an ejection fraction of greater than 55%, mild right\\nventricular dilation and mild pulmonary arterial pressure.\\nPulmonary function tests were performed showing obstructive\\npattern with FEC of 2.56 which is 93% of the predicted and\\nFEV1 of 0.9 which is 43% of the predicted in FEV1 to FEC\\nratio of 46%.\\n\\nWhen the patient was transferred to the Medical Floor, a CT\\nwas performed showed no evidence of a pulmonary embolism but\\ndid show signs of emphysema.  Sputum cultures were sent and\\nshowed no growth of any organism.  Alpha antitrypsin was sent\\nout but is still pending.\\n\\n2.  Pulmonary Embolism - The patient was continued on\\nCoumadin for an INR between 2 and 3.

Psychiatry was called to consult\\nand recommended that she be on Risperidone at 0.25 mg q hs.\\nThe patient did well on this medication.\\n\\n4.  Oncology - Multiple myeloma.

Bone marrow biopsy was done\\nrevealing 70 to 80 percent plasma cells.  Given these\\nfindings, the patient was then transferred to the \\nfor start of chemotherapy with Vincristine,\\n................... and Decadron in preparation for bone\\nmarrow transplant to be done.\\n\\n\\n\\n                             , M.D.  \\n\\nDictated By:\\nMEDQUIST36\\n\\nD:    15:47\\nT:    15:46\\nJOB#:  \\n             5943            5591      F  BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN   Private     None         SINGLE      EMERGENCY 2108-04-06 15:49:00                49                                                   Sodium; MCH; PT; RDW; White Blood Cells; Oxygen; pH; Creatinine; Glucose; Immunoglobulin M               148.0         402   49320, 51881, 486, 20300, 2761                9\n"
